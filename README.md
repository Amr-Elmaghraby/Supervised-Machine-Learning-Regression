## Overview

Supervised machine learning regression is a powerful technique used to predict continuous numeric values based on input features. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of regression algorithms, along with practical implementations and examples.

## Implemented Regression Algorithms

The repository currently includes implementations and examples for the following regression algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

Each regression algorithm is implemented using popular machine learning libraries and accompanied by clear explanations and usage examples.

## Usage

To use the regression algorithms provided in this repository, simply clone the repository or download the desired implementation files. Each regression algorithm has its own folder, containing the necessary code, documentation, and example datasets.

Feel free to explore the implementations, experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters, and integrate the algorithms into your own projects. The documentation and example scripts provided within each algorithm folder will guide you through the usage and customization process.
